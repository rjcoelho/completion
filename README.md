completion
==========

Enables and configures smart and extensive tab completion.

This module calls `compinit` for you. You should remove any `compinit` calls from
your `~/.zshrc` when you use this module.

Initialize this module *after* all modules that add completion definitions, like
[zsh-users/zsh-completions] for example.

Settings
--------

By default, the completion configuration is dumped to `${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zcompdump`.
This file is produced to speed up the completion initialization. The file path
can be customized with the following zstyle:

    zstyle ':zim:completion' dumpfile '/path/to/zsh_dumpfile'

The completion cache is stored in the `${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zcompcache` directory
by default. This path can be customized to a proper cache directory with:

    zstyle ':zim:completion' cache-path ${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/zsh/zcompcache

or

    zstyle ':zim:completion' cache-path ~/.cache/zsh/zcompcache

Add the zstyles to your `~/.zshrc` before where the modules are initialized.

Zsh options
-----------

  * `ALWAYS_TO_END` moves cursor to end of word if a full completion is inserted.
  * `NO_CASE_GLOB` makes globbing case insensitive.
  * `NO_LIST_BEEP` doesn't beep on ambiguous completions.
